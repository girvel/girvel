### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nikita Dobrynin, a programmer from Perm, Russia, a. k. a. girvel.

- I work as **Python developer**
- I am currently learning **Rust**
- I have a habit of compulsively developing **games**. The latest one is [Rex Astra](https://github.com/girvel/rex_astra), very very simple RTS. Lately it feels like developing games is more fun than playing them. 
- I am quite proud of my [own interpretation of ECS](https://github.com/girvel/ecs) on python. System are functions with *annotation*-based syntax, that are applied to *cartesian product* of entities that match arguments. Almost *dynamic* (you can dynamically add a component to the entity, but you can not dynamically add a system), somewhat *asynchronous* (it uses yield instead of await because it fits better). 
- I am very open to collaborations. I would love to write something open-source in a team. Contact me on my telegram [@girvel](https://t.me/girvel) and discord [Girvel#7522](https://discordapp.com/users/Girvel#7522).
