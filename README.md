### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nikita Dobrynin, a programmer from Perm, Russia, a. k. a. girvel.

- I work as **Python developer**
- I am currently learning **Rust**
- I have a habit of compulsively developing **games**. The latest one is [Metaworld](https://github.com/girvel/metaworld), non-visual novel. Lately it feels like developing games is more fun than playing them. 
- I am quite proud of my [own interpretation of ECS](https://github.com/girvel/ecs). System are functions with annotation-based syntax, that are applied to cartesian product of entities that match arguments. Almost dynamic, somewhat asynchronous. 
- I am very open to collaborations. I would love to write something open-source in a team. Contact me on my telegram [@girvel](https://t.me/girvel) and discord [Girvel#7522](https://discordapp.com/users/Girvel#7522).
