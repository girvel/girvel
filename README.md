### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nikita Dobrynin, a programmer from Perm, Russia, a. k. a. girvel.

- I work as **Python developer**
- I am currently learning **Rust**
- I admire **Lua** and **LOVE**
- I have a habit of compulsively developing **games**. The latest one is [Rex Astra](https://github.com/girvel/rex_astra), very very simple RTS built with LOVE. Lately it feels like developing games is more fun than playing them. 
- I am quite proud of my [own interpretation of ECS](https://github.com/girvel/ecs) on python. System are functions with **annotation**-based syntax, that are applied to **cartesian product** of entities that match arguments. Almost **dynamic** (you can dynamically add a component to the entity, but you can not dynamically add a system), somewhat **asynchronous** (it uses yield instead of await because it fits better). 
- I wrote [Tiny Storage](https://github.com/girvel/tiny_storage) -- a minimalistic YAML **config** management library for Python, that is often quite helpful.
- I am very open to collaborations. I would love to write something open-source in a team. Contact me on my telegram [@girvel](https://t.me/girvel), discord [Girvel#7522](https://discordapp.com/users/Girvel#7522) and email *widauka@ya.ru*.
