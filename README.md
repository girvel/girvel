### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Nikita Dobrynin, a programmer from Perm, Russia, a. k. a. girvel.

- I work as **Python software developer**
- I am currently learning **nothing**
- I admire **Lua** and **LOVE**
- I am quite proud of my [own interpretation of ECS](https://github.com/girvel/ecs) on python. System are functions with **annotation**-based syntax, that are applied to **cartesian product** of entities that match arguments' annotations. Almost **dynamic** (you can dynamically add a component to the entity, but you can not dynamically add a system), somewhat **asynchronous** (it uses yield instead of await because it fits better).
- I have a habit of compulsively developing **games**. My latest one is [Fallen](https://github.com/girvel/fallen), detail-focused TUI mini-RPG. I kind of revisited my ECS library a year after and its quality did not cause me to cry, so I was kind of inspired to try and build something on top of it. The project is a bit more about beauty of the code behind the game than the game itself. 
- Another one of my games is [Rex Astra](https://github.com/girvel/rex_astra), very very simple RTS built with LOVE. 
- I wrote [Tiny Storage](https://github.com/girvel/tiny_storage) -- a minimalistic YAML **config** management library for Python, that is often quite helpful.
- I am very open to collaborations. I would love to write something open-source in a team. Contact me on my telegram [@girvel](https://t.me/girvel), discord [Girvel#7522](https://discordapp.com/users/Girvel#7522) and email *widauka@ya.ru*.
